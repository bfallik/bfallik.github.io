    <p>Brian Fallik is an engineering executive who helps development teams manage the organizational and technological complexities of building software. Having spent 20+ years in the industry, from startups where the entire company satisfies <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/30/jeff-bezos-2-pizza-rule-can-help-you-hold-more-productive-meetings.html">Bezos’ Two Pizza Rule</a> all the way up to the Fortune 10, Brian drives the engines of software innovation. Regardless of scale he knows that high performance teams rely on effective communication to drive strong collaboration.</p>
<p>While at Vanu, Brian helped commercialize the nascent field of software-defined radio by building cellular (3G) base stations for GSM networks. At litl Brian helped introduce the world to the webbook, the &ldquo;world&rsquo;s first true cloud-based netbook.” Brian built Aereo’s video streamer to provide time-shifted DVR capabilities for over-the-air broadcast television. Most recently Brian has been helping clypd revolutionize the targeting capabilities for traditional (linear) TV advertising. As the head of engineering Brian was part of the core team that helped sell the company to Xandr (ATT) and designed and executed the plan to integrate clypd into the larger organization.</p>
<p>As an angel investor Brian focuses on deals that have a positive local impact and on founders from diverse and traditionally underrepresented backgrounds. Brian is active within <a href="https://tbdangels.com/">TBD Angles</a> and has participated in deals across fintech, marketing, and health care domains.</p>
<p>Brian holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Cornell University. Despite his technical background he probably can’t help fix your computer.</p>
